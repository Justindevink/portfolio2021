            <p class="aboutp">Justin de Vink is a Dutch UX &amp; Visual Designer in training who studies Communication &amp; Multimedia Design at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. He worked as an IT guy in the city hall of Zaandam for a couples of years, when he decided that he wanted to do something where he could let his mind and ideas run free.</p>
            <p class="aboutp">Since then he’s been making the coolest and craziest projects like website and app re-designs, projects with focus on user flow, customer experience and information architecture but also IoT projects, non-web/mobile app projects and even some voice UX projects. Realizing them mostly in Adobe XD, Figma or Invision and sometimes developing them in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
            <p class="aboutp">But enough of that, who is Justin when he's not on his computer making websites or apps? He's probably still on his computer, even building them (wow!), playing video games like Zelda or Dark souls, watching anime or maybe Star Wars for the 18th time. He likes to listen to (almost) every kind of music, mainly Hiphop or Metal. He’s also reading a lot of manga lately, mostly the (in)famously long One Piece series. And lastly he is equally a cat person as he is a dog person, he also has a strange love for raccoons for some reason.</p>
